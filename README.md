# Programmers unite!
This repo was created to organize & improve the life of software profesionals. 
We have the power to commit changes and deploy on production, don't forget this.

## Purpose

**more money, better contracts**
- offer a refuge out of "outsourcing" practices that plague the industry
- advocate for and seek direct relation between `programmer` and `end customer`
- support and demand fair contracts (both employment or b2b) for programmers without abusive clauses
- seek group legal assistance deals for legal protection and for any raised concerns
- seek group accountancy assistance deals and consultancy for raised concerns

**real continuous professional growth**
- support professionals that want to change technologies with guidance and opportunities
- develop and publicize clear standards of judging technological competency, guide a clear path to career advancement

**promote cooperatives**
- promote & support profit sharing between companies & developers
- promote & support in any way the creation of `cooperative software agencies`

## Why github
Is free to use and we all know how to use it.

## Files
- **README.md** is just an intro, specifics about some topic has to have its own file
- **charter.md** is a document that describes how we function as an (informal) organization.

## How to use this
**Issues:**
- use it like forum topics and exploring things that have not been yet transformed into issues

**Pull Requests**
- unless it's something trivial, please open an Issue first, so a PR always references some previous discussion
