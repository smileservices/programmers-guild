A napkin with starting up a programmer's guild. Please feel free to add to the document and help get the ball rolling!

# why a programmer's guild?
As a professional software engineer active in the field for 15+ years I feel like we lack a proper organization that would help a improve our lives in some key points. Here's some of them that came on top of my head. This is about counseling or services:

## career development
Let's be serious, unless you're working for a big company, no one will take your development as a developer seriously unless it will mean a + on the company balance sheet. That's a job most of us have to take on themselves, especially if it's some technology that's not used directly by the employer.
**i want the programmers guild to** be a "beacon of hope" for our career development and assist me with advice and/or opportunities. An example would be "hey, i have been doing embedded programming so far and it's driving me mad. Should i get into web dev and where do i start?" I want to be able to find a good, actual response to this question without going through old, downvoted stackoverflow and reddit threads. Also, i want to get referenced good books/courses, etc. Who and how? This remains to be discussed.

## interviews and standards of quality
We're changing projects/jobs like socks and it's a shame that we have to go through the interview process everytime. Some make their tech interview a whole day of work, some wants you to split the atom, some just don't know what to ask. I think it would be in both us and the recruiters interest to have a more streamlined and standardised process for recruiting in this industry.
**i want the programmers guild to** establish a reliable way to measure the seniority of programmers and standardize the technical interviewing process. How? This remains to be discussed.

## legal
Work contract or B2B? Direct with the company or through a 3rd party? Is the contract legal? Should you negotiate some of the terms? This industry has some specificities and it's not easy to find good legal counsel. We are working globally and there are many perils, both for us and the employer company. What do you do if a company ends your contract without respecting the terms? I think a higher level organization should definetely clear things up and become a source of trust on this topic.
**i want the programmers guild to** protect my legal and contractual rights, provide general counsel and be able to at least recommend some good professionals to globally handle any type of legal matters. Who and how? This remains to be discussed.

## accountancy
Work contract or B2B, there are still a whole lot of questions here as the customer can be in USA and you in Romania. They can't have a work contract without a 3rd party mediating. If you're a company, do you pay VAT or not? As software is a business with minimal inputs, the accountancy is minimal. The accountant fees should also be smaller than usual. 
**i want the programmers guild to** to negotiate some good business terms for its members with accountancy companies. Who and how? This remains to be discussed.

## 3rd party deals
Most of us can work remotely. Most of us use all sorts of services such as banking, restaurants, etc and we spend quite a lot as we are top earners. **i want the programmers guild to** negotiace some group deals for its members such as plane tickets, global health insurances, better loan rates, etc. Who and how? This remains to be discussed.
